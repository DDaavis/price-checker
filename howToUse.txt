How to use:

- Delete the 'database.db' file if you don't need the existing data

- Run main.py

- Add your product(s) in the 'Add a Product' tab
    - If you made a mistake, you can delete the product in the 'Delete a Product' tab
    - Or use the 'Delete a Product' tab if you don't need the price of a product anymore*

- Go back to the 'Category' tab
    - 'Get Prices' button will get the current product price(s) based on what category/product/shop you have selected
    - 'Get Graph' button will create a graph based on your database and what category/product/shop you have selected

If you need to add a new shop or category:

- Adding a category is easy:
    - Head to 'userInterface.py' and find the 'availableCategories' array and add your category

- Adding a shop is not as easy:
    - Head to 'helpers.py' and add the code for getting prices from your shop & name the function get_price_from_YourShopName
    - Now head over to 'userInterface.py' and find the 'availableShops' array and add your shop, where the name must match YourShopName

* - Deleting a product will wipe it from the database, which means the graph will not show it anymore.
